# Audio Knob Demo (Xamarin)
### Sample Knob control developed using Petra and Xamarin

The samples demonstrate creating an audio knob control from Sketch drawing, the drawing is available at [free sketch app resources](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/3055-realistic-audio-knobs-sketch-freebie-resource.html), the modified Sketch drawing used to build the samples is included in this code reposotory.

There are two samples, one demosntrating dynamic CoreGraphics drawing generated by Petra, the other sample demosntrates petras' ability to generate UIImages during runtime without the need to bundle any image resources.

Advantages of using Petra

* Get rid of multi-resolution images overhead
* Rapid prototyping of UI Components
* Fast native 2D drawing code,resolution independent and scalable
* Update your drawings without the overhead of hand coding them again
* Build Styles and Themes
* Customize code to add interaction and dynamic behavior
